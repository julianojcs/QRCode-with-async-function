# QRCode-with-async-function
A Simple QRCode Generator developed with pure **Javascript**

## Project description:
- A simple script to generate a QRCode and dowload it as an png image. You will be able to set the width/height, colors and the text (could be an url) to be coded. Also, we use an async function (async/await) to generate the QRCode and then we create a link to download the png image. The async funtion garantee that the link will be able to be used only when the QRCode is done.

## References:
This project use the davidshimjs project to generate the QRCode. Please visit [his page](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs) to check it out.
